Summary: How this website was made.</p>

<p>Designing this blog has been a bit of an adventure and I wanted to share it.</p>

<p>Where to start?</p>

<h3>Direction</h3>

<p>Well, the first thing I needed was a bit of direction on what this website would be about.  The basic theme was relatively simple, I have a number of other projects and I wanted a space to talk about the creative process I was/am going through, but I wanted this space to be a bit more than that.  I wanted personality.  I&rsquo;m a programmer, a designer, and a scientist and I wanted each of those to be communicated without compromising the other.  Tough.</p>

<p>I sat on it awhile.  I knew I wanted to show a tiny bit of fun programming, specifically animations in the browser using SVG, and that sort of led me to looking into cogs and gears.  Conceptually, this made a few dimensions of sense.  I could have my little programming sub project in making the animations, it&rsquo;s not hard to jump from the visual of gears to science, and lets face it, they&rsquo;re just fun.</p>

<p>So, I made <this small gear library>, using D3.js, <this example>, and a random gif I found online of an asymmetrical planetary gear configuration.</p>

<p>But, there was a bit of a problem.  The gears were cool, but they weren&rsquo;t enough by themselves.  In fact, the gears weren&rsquo;t just cool, they seemed a bit cold and I had no idea how to address that.</p>

<p>So, again, I sat on it, or rather, I had the luxury to sit on it.  My brain was chewing on the problem.  I had no deadlines, really, this was a personal project.  That can be a good or a very bad thing.</p>

<p>Some months later, I bought a gold-painted, resin-molded elephant head on etsy.</p>

<p>If that sounds random, it is and thats the point, because that&rsquo;s how I broke out of the slump.  Literally, as I spilled packing peanuts pulling the faux gold elephant face out of the ups box, I remember turning to my girlfriend and saying &ldquo;I should just call the website &lsquo;the Mechanical Elephant that remembers everything Matthew Griffith has done&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Click.  There it was.  Warmth.  It had a face(though he looks a bit angry).  It had resonances in contemplation with the memory of elephants.  The gears could be those thoughts, churning in the Elephant&rsquo;s head.  It now felt like a living character I was working with now and his name happened to be Mortimer.</p>

<p>I sketched Mortimer from a picture on my phone, while on a flight out to California .</p>

<p>The rest of the design happened quickly.</p>

<h3>Color</h3>

<p>I had recently found <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/usgsbiml/">the bee collection</a>, which I really loved, the color just stunned me.  I extracted the colors from one of my favorites using this website&lt;> and added that to the styling sheet palette.  To maintain a tight communication of functionality, I made the color communicate &ldquo;hey, this is clickable&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Backgound Texture</h3>

<p>Hard to go wrong with subtlepatterns.com.  I wanted the main body to have a white background, so I darkened one of the patterns to maintain a good balance of dark and light.</p>

<h3>Typography</h3>

<p>The subject of typography goes all the way down, but basically I wanted both a serif font to communicate a feeling of older, authoritarian science, with feelings of marble and ancient libraries.  And a sans-serif for a modern feel to balance that out.  I ended up with ____  and Open Sans.</p>

<p>Making things superbly readable is easy.<br/>
Basically, you do this to your CSS/LESS/SASS:</p>

<pre>.readable {
        width:        700px;
        line-height:  1.2em;
        font-size:    18px;
}</pre>


<h3>And so&hellip;</h3>

<p>What did I contribute here?  Most everything was taken from somewhere else, iterated on, recombined.  I contributed the glue and the frequent, vague feeling that something wasn&rsquo;t working.  That feeling developed into reflection, observation and sheer frustration.  And it kept me moving and searching for what could patch it up.</p>

<p>Buying the elephant head was a quirky whim.  I think if I were to sum up what I would take away from this whole experience, it&rsquo;s to cultivate those whims.  Those whims might become part of your creative pallet some day.</p>

<p>All in all, I feel it was hard work for an honest thief.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m happy with it.</p>
