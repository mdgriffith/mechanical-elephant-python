<p>Type System ->  Basic Construction</p>

<p>data ScreenUnit = Pixels Int | Em Int | Percent Int</p>

<p>This means, when I say I have ScreenUnit that it is either a Pixels, an Em, or a Percent.  If I try to add a Pixels unit to an Em, the program wont compile.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this a good construction ? *</li>
</ul>
